232: Following Harmon \& Kapatsinski (2017), two artificial languages were
  233: used: called Dan and Nem (See Figure~\ref{fig-fig1}). In each language,
  234: the same four suffixes were used: -\emph{sil\textsubscript{PL}},
  235: \emph{-dan\textsubscript{PL}}, \emph{-nem\textsubscript{DIM}}, and
  236: -\emph{shoon\textsubscript{DIM}}. Notably, in our language \emph{-dan}
  237: and \emph{-sil} overlap in meaning (they both occur in plural contexts),
  238: and -\emph{nem} and \emph{-shoon} also overlap in meaning (they both
  239: occur in diminutive contexts). Since all four suffixes are possible
  240: candidates for the diminutive plural meaning, we can examine how

  242: affect its likelihood of being extended to express the diminutive plural

260: During the exposure phase, each suffix was paired with an image. The
  261: suffixes -\emph{sil\textsubscript{PL}} and \emph{-dan\textsubscript{PL}}
  262: were always paired with a picture of multiple large pictures. On the
  263: other hand, the suffixes \emph{-nem\textsubscript{DIM}} and
  264: -\emph{shoon\textsubscript{DIM}} were always paired with a picture of a
  265: single small creature. The design of the stimuli results in participants
  266: being able to learn that -\emph{sil} and \emph{-dan} are either simply
  267: plural or simply non-diminutive. Similarly, \emph{-nem} and
  268: \emph{-shoon} can be learned as either simply singular or simply
  269: diminutive.
  270: 
  271: Our Experiment comprised of three different conditions (see
  272: Table~\ref{tbl-conditionslist}), one in which the type frequency of the
  273: frequent suffix (i.e., \emph{dan} in Dan and \emph{nem} in Nem) was
  274: higher than the type frequency of the infrequent suffix (by a factor of
  275: 4 or 12 vs.~3) while the token frequency of the two suffixes was matched
  276: and set equal to the type frequency of the frequent suffix (both at 12).
  277: We refer to this condition as Type. In the second condition, the token
  278: frequency of the frequent suffix was higher than the token frequency of
  279: the infrequent suffix (by a factor of 4 or 12 vs.~3) while holding the
  280: type frequency of the two suffixes equal to the type frequency of the
  281: infrequent suffix (both at 3). We refer to this condition as Token.
  282: Finally, in the third condition, we manipulated both the type and token
  283: frequency of the frequent suffix such that the token and type frequency
  284: of the frequent suffix were both greater than the token and type
  285: frequency of the infrequent suffix (by a factor of 4 or 12 vs.~3). We
  286: refer to this condition as Type-Token. In this context, a higher type
  287: frequency corresponds to the suffix appearing with a larger number of
  288: distinct stems relative to the competing suffix, while a larger token
  289: frequency corresponds to simply appearing a greater number of times
  290: relative to the competing suffix, regardless of the number of different
  291: stems it occurs with.
  292: 
  293: Our Experiment comprised of three different conditions (see
  294: Table~\ref{tbl-conditionslist}), varying type and token frequencies of
  295: the competing suffixes. Type frequency corresponds to the number of
  296: distinct stems with which a suffix appears, while token frequency
  297: corresponds to the number of occurrences of a suffix, regardless of the
  298: number of different stems it occurs with. In the Type condition, the
  299: type frequency of the frequent suffix (i.e., \emph{dan} in Dan and
  300: \emph{nem} in Nem) was higher than the type frequency of the infrequent
  301: suffix (by a factor of 4 or 12 vs.~3) while the token frequency of the
  302: two suffixes was matched and set equal to the type frequency of the
  303: frequent suffix (both at 12). The frequent suffix in this condition has
  304: a lower token/type ratio than the rare suffix.
  305: 
  306: In the Token condition, the token frequency of the frequent suffix was
  307: higher than the token frequency of the infrequent suffix (by a factor of
  308: 4 or 12 vs.~3) while the type frequencies of the two suffixes were equal
  309: (both at 3). In this condition, both suffixes co-occurred with the same
  310: types. The frequent suffix in this condition has a higher token/type
  311: ratio than the rare suffix.
  312: 
  313: In the Type-Token condition, we manipulated both the type and token
  314: frequency of the frequent suffix such that the token and type frequency
  315: of the frequent suffix were both greater than the token and type
  316: frequency of the infrequent suffix (by a factor of 4 or 12 vs.~3). In

Similar to the aforementioned tasks, in the comprehension task some of the stems were familiar (i.e., seen in training) and others were novel (i.e., not seen in training).

453: In order to determine whether the effect of frequency on semantic

  455: mixed-effects model on the production data. The dependent variable was
  456: whether the participant produced the frequent suffix. The frequent

  458: language or chose \emph{nem} in the Nem language.

646: In order to examine the results for the comprehension task, similar to
  647: the previous tasks we ran a mixed-effects regression model. The
  648: dependent variable was whether the meaning that participants selected
  649: was novel or original. A positive estimate indicates that participants
  650: chose the novel meaning while a negative estimate indicates that
  651: participants were more likely to choose the original meaning. In
  652: production and form-choice, participants are choosing between suffixes
  653: that differ in frequency. In comprehension, participants instead are
  654: presented with a single affix that has a certain type frequency, token
  655: frequency, and token/type ratio, and a frequent suffix from one
  656: condition can have the same characteristics as an infrequent suffix from
  657: another condition. Since participants are not comparing suffixes in
  658: comprehension, we expect equally distributed suffixes to have the same
  659: effect. Thus, the independent variable chosen was the distribution of
  660: the presented suffix: 12 tokens and 12 types, 12 tokens and 3 types, or
  661: 3 tokens and 3 types. By comparing the 12-3 condition to the 12-12 and

  799: and learning is proportional to prediction error. Furthermore, type
  800: frequency helps generalization because it increases the likelihood that
  801: the generalization stimuli are within the similarity space covered by
  802: known stimuli (Hare et al., 1995). Therefore, much previous work has

  819: salience of an outcome when it is absent. Absent cues are generally
  820: assumed to have \(\alpha_C=0\) and are therefore not to be updated.
  821: Because we have no reason to believe some cues or outcomes are more
  822: salient than others, we assumed that \(\alpha_C=0.1\) for all present
  823: cues and \(\beta=1\) for both present and absent outcomes, yielding a
  824: learning rate of 0.1. The results do not qualitatively change with
  825: changes in learning rate. An outcome's activation, \(A_O\), denotes the
  826: sum of the association weights (V) from the present cues to that
  827: outcome, i.e., \(\sum_cV_{C\rightarrow O}\). Subtracting \(A_O\) from
  828: the appropriate limit (1 for present outcomes and 0 for absent ones)
  829: defines prediction error. The model is error-driven because the change
  830: in weight is proportional to prediction error: more is learned when the

  859: The model was trained on the same series of training trials as our human
  860: subjects, presented in random order. The cues represented stem identity
  861: along with the meaning (e.g., bal\_dim\_pl) and the outcome was the
  862: suffix that the stem occurred with on that trial (i.e., \emph{dan},
  863: \emph{nem}, \emph{sil}, or \emph{shoon}).
  864: 
  865: For each of the items in the production task, we computed activation of
  866: each outcome suffix. For example, given the item \emph{baldan} and the
  867: meaning BIG PLURAL, we summed the weights of associations from
  868: \emph{bal}, BIG, and PLURAL to \emph{dan}. The activation of \emph{dan}
  869: corresponds to its expected log odds given these cues. Passing it
  870: through the logistic activation function then generates its expected
  871: production probability.
  872: 
  873: We then calculated the difference in activation between the frequent
  874: suffix and the infrequent suffix given the semantic cues and the stem
  875: cue present on a particular trial. This corresponds to the expected
  876: effect of frequency on the log odds of choosing these suffixes when
  877: presented with a particular meaning and a particular stem. For example,
  878: the activation \emph{nem} receives when the subject is presented with
  879: its original meaning is the sum of activations from DIMINUTIVE, SINGULAR
  880: and the stem. It is the log odds of \emph{nem} in its original meaning.
  881: If the frequent suffix is \emph{dan}, then the activation of \emph{nem}
  882: would be subtracted from the activation \emph{dan} would receive in its
  883: original meaning, i.e., from BIG, PLURAL and the same stem. If
  884: \emph{nem} is the frequent suffix, then the subtraction is in the
  885: opposite direction. For the novel meaning, the semantic cues are
  886: DIMINITUVE and PLURAL for both suffixes. This results in a single value
  887: for each trial that is the model's expected log odds of the frequent
  888: suffix relative to the infrequent suffix given the stem and meaning
  889: (original or novel) on that trial.

  891: We evaluated the discrepancies between model predictions and human data
  892: by using expected log odds from the model as predictors in a Bayesian
  893: logistic regression models. In each model, the dependent variable was

  895: suffix or the infrequent suffix. The first model was a simple model that
  896: modeled the human data as a function of the logistic perceptron
  897: predictions.
  898: 
  899: Specifically, we used expected difference in log odds (referred to as
  900: freq\_minus\_infreq) with random intercepts for participant and stem
  901: identity ( Equation~\ref{eq-rwmodel1}). This model serves as a baseline.
  902: In our second model, we calculated separately the activation received by
  903: the suffix from the stem and from the meaning (using the perceptron).
  904: The motivation behind this is that the perceptron is agnostic to whether
  905: the cue is a stem or a meaning, but participants may show varying
  906: sensitivity to one over the other (e.g., Gagliardi et al., 2015, argue
  907: that learners are more sensitive to form cues than to semantic cues).
  908: Using the activation from the stem and the meaning as separate
  909: predictors allows the statistical model to fit different slopes for the
  910: stem activations and the meaning activations. We then added a
  911: fixed-effect for condition as well as an interaction effect between
  912: condition and the stem activations, and an interaction between the
  913: meaning activations and condition ( Equation~\ref{eq-rwmodel3}). This
  914: model tests whether the perceptron captures the effects of type and
  915: token frequency and their interactions with meaning and stem novelty, or

Further, a model with configural cues and increased salience of semantic cues fits the human data better than even the original statistical predictors. This parallels previous findings in demonstrating that humans learn associations for configural cues and that humans are more sensitive to semantic cues than phonological cues, and provides support for a connectionist approach to human cognition.

Original TEX:
1180: Our results suggest that in production, having a high type and high
 1181: token frequency together lead to a preference for the frequent suffix,
 1182: and this preference is even stronger if the stem is novel. On the other
 1183: hand, when there is a high type frequency but not a high token
 1184: frequency, there is only a preference for the frequent form when the
 1185: stem and meaning are both novel. Finally, for token frequency there is
 1186: only a preference for the frequent form when the meaning is original.
 1187: Overall, these results suggest that type frequency and token frequency
 1188: both play a role in semantic extension, with a high type frequency
 1189: encouraging semantic extension while a high token frequency encourages
 1190: using the suffix to communicate the original meaning. Similar to Harmon
 1191: \& Kapatsinski (2017), these effects are mitigated when both forms are
 1192: brought into memory.
 1193: 
 1194: A similar pattern emerges in comprehension. When there is a high
 1195: token-to-type ratio, the original meaning is preferred more. However,
 1196: when there are as many types as there are tokens, there is an increased
 1197: preference for the novel meaning relative to when there is a high
 1198: token-to-type ratio.
 1199: 
 1200: Our results also demonstrate that the Rescorla-Wagner model with a
 1201: logistic activation function is able to capture the human data. Further,
 1202: the model matches the human data best when it includes configural cues
 1203: and an increased salience for semantic cues relative to phonological
 1204: cues.
