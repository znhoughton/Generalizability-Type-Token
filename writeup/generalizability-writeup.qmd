# Methods

Following @harmonPuttingOldTools2017, two artificial languages were used: Dan and Nem [See @fig-fig1]. In each language, the same four suffixes were used: -*sil~PL~*, *-dan~PL~*, *-nem~DIM~*, and -*shoon~DIM~*. Notably, in our language *-dan* and *-sil* overlap in meaning (they both occur in plural contexts) as do -*nem* and *-shoon* (which both occur in diminutive contexts).

![A description of the suffixes in our artificial languages. The thicker lines denote the more frequent form in each language. The Dan language is on the left, the Nem language is on the right.](fig1.jpg){#fig-fig1}

During the exposure phase, the suffixes were paired with an image. The suffixes -*sil~PL~* and *-dan~PL~* were always paired with a picture of multiple large pictures. On the other hand, the suffixes *-nem~DIM~* and -*shoon~DIM~* were always paired with a picture of a single small creature. The design of the stimuli result in participants being able to learn that -*sil* and *-dan* are either simply plural or simply non-diminutive. Similarly, *-nem* and *-shoon* can be learned as either simply singular or simply diminutive. Thus the test phase tested this.

Our Experiment comprised of three different conditions (see @tbl-conditionslist), one in which the type frequency of the frequent language's suffix was manipulated (Condition 1), one in which the token frequency was manipulate3d (Condition 2), and one in which both were manipulated (Condition 3).

|   | Frequent Token | Frequent Type | Infrequent Token | Infrequent Type |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Condition 1** | 12 | 12 | 12 | 3 |
| **Condition 2** | 12 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **Condition 3** | 12 | 12 | 3 | 3 |

: Description of each of our conditions. Note that in Condition 1, there are an equal number of tokens between the frequent and infrequent items, however there are a greater number of types in the frequent items. In Condition 2, the opposite is true: the frequent items occur more, but in the same number of types as the infrequent items. Finally, in Condition 3, the frequent items occur both a greater number of times and in a greater number of different contexts.
